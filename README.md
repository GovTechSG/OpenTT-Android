# OpenTT-Android Documentation

This repository contains TraceTogether (Android) App source codes dated January 2021, and is published for reference. TraceTogether is Singaporeâ€™s national digital Bluetooth contact tracing solution to fight the spread of COVID-19. 

### Statement from the TraceTogether team
>In April 2020, we published OpenTrace, a reference implementation of BlueTrace (BlueTrace is the privacy-preserving protocol upon which TraceTogether is built). Since then, TraceTogether has implemented various improvements, such as interoperability with TraceTogether tokens, SafeEntry venue check-in, COVID Health Status.
>
>In response to public requests, we are publishing TraceTogether app source codes dated January 2021. Sensitive parts such as NRIC validation logic and TraceTogether image assets have been removed from this release. We had hoped to publish this earlier, but the team was caught up supporting increased contact tracing demands in recent months, and there were various security reviews necessary before publishing code.
>
>We thank you for your continued support towards community-driven contact tracing that has been designed, developed and deployed with love.

### Statement from Google
>At Google Play we take our responsibility to provide accurate and relevant information for our users very seriously. For that reason, we are currently only approving apps that reference COVID-19 or related terms in their store listing if the app is published, commissioned, or authorized by an official government entity or public health organization, and the app does not contain any monetization mechanisms such as ads, in-app products, or in-app donations. This includes references in places such as the app title, description, release notes, or screenshots.

### Note about security
We encourage all users of TraceTogether to update their operating systems regularly to get the latest security patches. For backwards compatibility, TraceTogether supports devices from Android OS 5.1 and above but we strongly encourage users to move to minimally Android OS 7 where possible. We also encourage users to always update their app to the latest version.
